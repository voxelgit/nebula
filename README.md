not your ordinary unblocker site. games, [chat](https://voxel.is-a.dev/nebula/chat.html), a [proxy](https://voxel.is-a.dev/nebula/pr0xy.html) and apps.

if your school ever restricts this just fork and deploy to GitHub Pages or use the following options:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/xnvz/nebula"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>
<a href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fxnvz%2Fnebula"><img src="https://vercel.com/button" alt="Deploy with Vercel"/></a>
<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/xnvz/nebula"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy">

..or just use the alt links if you don't want to selfhost.

# usage

see those files up there? slap them at the end of your link and you're good to go.

example: instance.link/reponame/file.html

(go to settings then pages and deploy so it works)
